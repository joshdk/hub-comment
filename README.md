# Hub-Comment

üìù Automate GitHub pull request comments in CI

## Installing

### From source

You can install a development version of this tool by running:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/joshdk/hub-comment
```

### Precompiled binary

Alternatively, you can download a precompiled [release][github-release-link] binary by running:

```bash
$ wget -q https://github.com/joshdk/hub-comment/releases/download/0.1.0/hub-comment_linux_amd64
$ sudo install hub-comment_linux_amd64 /usr/bin/hub-comment
```

## Usage

### Environment Setup

Since `hub-comment` communicates with the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), you must first create and export an API token into the working environment.

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN='2b6c...f4bd'
```

### Comment Template

You can write a comment template file, using the same syntax used for [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). For example, you could save the following as `hello-template.txt`:

```
ü§ñ Hello from CI!

Build #{{.Env.CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}} was run successfully.
```

### Running

```
$ hub-comment -template-file hello-template.txt
